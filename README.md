## Describe Giphy ------
Create an application that allows users to search Giphy for interesting GIFs.
      We want the user to be able to traverse popular giphys, search for key words to bring popular gifs and 
 Make sure to carefully read Giphy's documentation as you build out your application.

1. First, build out your application to allow users to search for GIFs using a keyword.

      * webpage with a user input and a div to display the api response.

2 .Next, add functionality so your users can see trending content from Giphy.

      * 

3. Finally, add a button that users can click to randomly see a GIF from Giphy.

4. More challenging: Add functionality so a user can upload content to Giphy. Note that the free tier only allows users to upload 10 files per day(using API POST here). You can apply for a production key if you'd like the option to add more.

5. Optional: Try adding a try...catch block to handle API errors without looking at future lessons on how to do this. Once again, this is good practice.
